# TuringSorter
A simple sorter, with a human comparator

Turing sorter allows you to rank items, with nothing more than a series of choices between two items on your list. Pick which one of the two you like better, and the Turing Sorter will figure out the ranking of items in your head.

## But why?

Maybe you need to narrow down a list of groomsmen (or just order them). Pick 3 things to for your one day in Rome, or maybe you just need to quickly figure out the priority of items on your to do list.
